# Homework 3

### 1. What are the advantages and disadvantages of the 256 bit word length in the EVM

**Advantages:**

1. Large address space for smart contracts and externally owned accounts, minimizing the chance of collision
2. Cryptographically compatible with keccak256 (SHA-256) hashing algorithm for ECSDA digital signatures

**Disadvantages:**

1. Reduced performance for computational operations, compared to smaller bit word length such as 8/16 bit integers due to the added complexity of 256-bit arithmetic operations.
2. Increase memory and storage requirements, since more memory and storage is needed for smart contract execution.

### 2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied between Ethereum clients?

1. Consensus issues, different outcomes produced for same transaction, leading to disagreement between state of blockchain. This may result in network forks, with clients maintaining different versions of the blockchain.
2. Smart contract inconsistencies, different behavior for the same written code, causing unreliable applications.
3. Security vulnerabilities, with the many implementations, it is likely that at least of of the implementations has a hidden security vulnerability that can be exploited by external actors.

### 3. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.
