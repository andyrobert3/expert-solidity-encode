### 1. Why is client diversity important for Ethereum?

### 3. What is a Replay attack? How to prevent it?

Replay attack is an attack where a malicious actor performs the same transaction as a previous known transaction, posing as the original user.

It can be prevented by adding a nonce & chain ID, that is signed by the user.

So a transaction cannot be copied, since its transaction hash will be different as the nonce is incremented for every transaction.

### 4. How do we know who called the view function?

"msg.sender" -> but we cannot rely on it because there is no one signing it, unlike a non-view function
